### Hey there!

I'm JesÃºs, a 22 yo. Argentinian programming student and Front-end Developer that (sometimes) knows how to center a div properly.

In all seriousness, I've been learning Web Development for almost a year now with the help of the folks at theodinproject.com/ and having a great time while doing so. Looking forward to keeping a steady pace and hopefully landing a job in IT in the near future.
Thanks for visiting my profile!
