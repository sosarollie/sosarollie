### Hey there!

I'm Jes√∫s, a 22 yo. Argentinian programming student and soon-to-be Front-end Developer that (sometimes) knows how to center a div properly.
In all seriousness, I've been learning Web Development for almost a year now with the help of the folks at theodinproject.com/ and having a great time while doing so.
